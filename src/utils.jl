    uncertainty(ν, α, β)

Calculates the epistemic uncertainty of the predictions from the Normal Inverse Gamma (NIG) model.
Given a ``\\text{N-}\\Gamma^{-1}(γ, υ, α, β)`` distribution we can calculate the epistemic uncertainty as

``Var[μ] = \\frac{β}{ν(α-1)}``

# Arguments:
- `ν`: the ν parameter of the NIG distribution which relates to it's precision and whose shape should be (O, B)
- `α`: the α parameter of the NIG distribution which relates to it's precision and whose shape should be (O, B)
- `β`: the β parameter of the NIG distribution which relates to it's uncertainty and whose shape should be (O, B)

"""
    uncertainty(α, β)

Calculates the aleatoric uncertainty of the predictions from the Normal Inverse Gamma (NIG) model.
Given a ``\\text{N-}\\Gamma^{-1}(γ, υ, α, β)`` distribution we can calculate the aleatoric uncertainty as

``\\mathbb{E}[σ^2] = \\frac{β}{(α-1)}``

# Arguments:

Calculates the epistemic uncertainty associated with a MultinomialDirichlet model (DIR) layer.

"""
    evidence(α)

Calculates the total evidence of assigning each observation in α to the respective class for a DIR layer.

"""
    evidence(ν, α)

Returns the evidence for the data pushed through the NIG layer. In this setting one way of looking at the NIG
distribution is as ν virtual observations governing the mean μ of the likelihood and α virtual observations governing the variance ``\\sigma^2``. The evidence is then a sum of the virtual observations. Amini et. al. goes through this interpretation in their 2020 paper.

# Arguments:
